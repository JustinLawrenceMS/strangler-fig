To see a live demo, point your browser to <a href="https://techballet.net/cdc/">JSON Interface with Autocomplete</a>.


This is just an example of what you can do with a JSON dataset. Short and sweet, the CDC's is actually very nice but here you have the Cliff Note's, and source code to boot.  To implement it, just do:

```git clone https://github.com/JustinLawrenceMS/json_typeahead```

The dataset comes from the Centers of Disease Control.
jQuery comes from jQuery and Bootstrap comes from Bootstrap.
