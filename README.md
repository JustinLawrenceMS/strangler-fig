# JSON Dataset

This was a hobby website intended solely to demonstrate raw, procedural PHP as an interface for a Centers for Disease Control JSON dataset. Now it's a demo of strangler fig pattern using Laravel. You can see it deployed [here](https://json-dataset.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
To use it, clone it and spin it up using Laravel Sail.

## Demo
Check out the live demo [here](https://json-dataset.herokuapp.com/).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Notes:

The branches are organized by stages of strangler fig, ie strangler_fig_part_1 etc.

In strangler fig part 2, public/legacy.php and public/index.php are important but were drowned out by noise from laravel repo init.
