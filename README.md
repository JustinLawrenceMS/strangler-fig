# json_typeahead
Example of raw PHP json solution using bootstrap/jquery autocomplete and CDC JSON dataset.

To see a live demo, point your browser to <a href="https://techballet.net/cdc/">JSON Interface with Autocomplete</a>.


This is just an example of what you can do with a JSON dataset. Short and sweet, the CDC's official interface is actually very nice and I do not contend that this is an improvement, but here you have an abbreviated version, with source code.  To implement it, just do:

```git clone https://github.com/JustinLawrenceMS/json_typeahead```

The dataset comes from the Centers of Disease Control.
jQuery comes from jQuery and Bootstrap comes from Bootstrap.
