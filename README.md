# json_typeahead
Example of raw PHP json solution using bootstrap/jquery autocomplete and CDC JSON dataset.

This was just an experiment I did when I was looking for the best raw autocomplete solution as well as learning JSON.  Hopefully it helps someone.
It's out-of-date, sloppy, and unforgiveably bad, but it should work out of the box.  To implement it, just do:

```git clone https://github.com/JustinLawrenceMS/json_typeahead```

The dataset comes from the Centers of Disease Control.
jQuery comes from jQuery and Bootstrap comes from Bootstrap.
