# json-dataset

This is a hobby Website intended solely to demonstrate raw, procedural PHP as an interface for 
a Centers for Disease Control JSON dataset.  It ended up pretty fast and not incredibly verbose.

To use it, clone the repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/JustinLawrenceMS/json-dataset.git
```

Then, navigate to app root by doing this:

```
cd json-dataset
```

This spin up a Web server:

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public/
```

You have to have PHP installed.
